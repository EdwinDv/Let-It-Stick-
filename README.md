My submission to the Congressional App Challenge.

A tool that allows one to increase their English vocabulary quickly.

For Linux, download the jar and lib files and run the command:

java -cp "Let It Stick.jar:/home/YourUserName/Directory/lib/*" Let.It.Stick.DictionaryWindow

changing 'YourUserName' and 'Directory'.

The same applies to Windows and Mac OS, but the directories differ.
